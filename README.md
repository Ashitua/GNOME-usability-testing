 GNOME USABILITY  TESTING Tuesday, October 30, 2018 First contribution to usability testing Here is my contribution, am applying for the GNOME usability testing internship.  What is usability testing? Usability testing to me is a process,a crucial process that developers need to determine the impact of a software to the general public. This process is important as it helps determine the usefulness of a software,making sure that it achieves it's designed roles in the community. I am interested in this project as I am hoping to unravel better ways to accomplish tasks and showcase/recommend new ideas?.
